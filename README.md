# Flash Player

### Inspiration
Epilepsy is a chronic non-communicable disease of the brain that affects people of all ages. In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that approximately 50 million people worldwide have epilepsy. This makes it the most common neurological disease globally, and unfortunately, there is no cure.
Triggers of epilepsy can occur from sleep deprivation, stress, flashing lights, and many other provocations. With thousands of tweets, posts and videos at our fingertips, for those with epilepsy, it is easier to land upon a video that contains a segment of flashing colours. 

### About
Flash Player is a chrome extension that prevents epileptic seizures by skipping parts of videos with flashing lights. 
Upon opening Flash Player on YouTube, users can scan videos for triggers of seizures. When reaching a segment with a trigger, Flash Player will skip to a non-trigger segment.

### How we built it
The chrome extension was built using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. The backend used a Flask server with a MongoDB database to interact with the Chrome extension. OpenCV and Numpy were used for the video analysis to determine what parts of the video have triggers.

### What's next for Flash Player
- Implement red saturation analysis in addition to luminosity 
- Increasing performance times to reduce time required 
- Improving accuracy of the algorithm by applying machine learning techniques
